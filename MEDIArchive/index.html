				<h3>About MEDIArchive</h3>
				<h4>MEDIArchive</h4>
				<p>MEDIArchive is an application that we want to create to keep track of various media and your progress made through them. For example, a series of movies or books. In today's society, we have a lot of media we can take in. Too much, even. It becomes difficult to remember what exactly you've seen and read or listened to. This application will be a much needed way of ensuring that you don't lose track of all of this.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Link to other accounts</li>
					<li>Search a database for information</li>
					<li>Go straight to watching the media you just searched</li>
